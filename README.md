# Disaster Tweet Detector

## Project Overview

This project is a participation the Kaggle challenge [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview).

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. First responders are increasingly monitoring Twitter as it gives near real-time information. But they might face difficulties to clearly identify if a person is anouncing a disaster.
With many tweets containing metaphores, the task can be tricky. 

I built a solution based on Supervised Learning that can identify if a tweet is related to a real disaster or not.
